  <h1>What are Quantum Circuits?</h1>
  <p>A quantum circuit is a network of wires, where we imagine qubits traveling around and going through different quantum gates.
      To understand what this actually looks like, it will be much easier to first understand probabilistic circuits</p>
  <h2>Probabilistic Circuits</h2>
  <p>If you've ever drawn a <italic>probability</italic> tree, you've also drawn a probabilistic circuit!</p>
  <img src='Assets/probability_tree.gif' style="float:right;width:350px;">
  <p>For example, if you have a biased coin colored blue and red, which lands with the blue side up 60% of the time, 
    and the red side up 40% of the time. We can describe the process of flipping this coin twice using the probability tree to the right.<br>
    Follow the probability mass as it progresses through the tree (highlighted in green), 
    and notice that we're multiplying the green probability mass with the weight of the edge 
    to see how much probability mass will be at the next node (this concept is useful to understand quantum circuits later). <br></p>
    <p>The probability tree to the right represents two consecutive coin tosses, and let's say we're going to consider 
    it a "win" if we flip different colors in our consecutive tosses. We can then get the overall probability of success 
      by adding up all the final probability masses that correspond to different colors being flipped, so in this case 0.24+0.24 = 0.48, not too bad odds!</p>
