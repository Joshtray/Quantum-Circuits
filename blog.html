  <h1>What are Quantum Circuits?</h1>
  <p>A quantum circuit is a network of wires, where we imagine qubits traveling around and going through different quantum gates.
      To understand what this actually looks like, it will be much easier to first understand probabilistic circuits</p>
  <h2>Probabilistic Circuits</h2>
  <p>If you've ever drawn a <italic>probability</italic> tree, you've also drawn a probabilistic circuit!</p>
  <img src='Assets/probability_tree.gif' style="float:right;width:350px;">
  <p>For example, if you have a biased coin colored blue and red, which lands with the blue side up 60% of the time, 
    and the red side up 40% of the time. We can describe the process of flipping this coin twice using the probability tree to the right.<br></p>
    <p>Follow the probability mass as it progresses through the tree (highlighted in green), 
    and notice that we're multiplying the green probability mass with the weight of the edge 
    to see how much probability mass will be at the next node (this concept is useful to understand quantum circuits later). <br></p>
    <p>The probability tree to the right represents two consecutive coin tosses, and let's say we're going to consider 
    it a "win" if we flip different colors in our consecutive tosses. We can then get the overall probability of success 
      by adding up all the final probability masses that correspond to different colors being flipped, so in this case 0.24+0.24 = 0.48, not too bad odds!<br></p>
  <p>Now, the example above describes two coin flips and the potential outcomes, but the true power of probabilistic circuits comes 
  when we can employ them for different algorithms. In that case, we have some input on the left-hand side and a probability associated with each possible outcome. 
    Yes, this means that a probabilistic algorithm isn't guaranteed to give the right answer. That might feel weird, but actually, most generative AI that we're used to today
  are probabilistic, the model assigns a certain probability to each next word in the response!<br></p>

  <p>
    In the gif above, we see a setup that takes in two inputs and throws out two outputs. We could call it a gate, much like how logic gates take in inputs on a circuit.
    As you might see, this specific gate gives out 50% to the top and 50% to the bottom, no matter what the input is. This specific gate actually has a name: the Hadamard Gate!
    <br>
    Now, I want you to imagine placing two of these in a row so that the outputs of the first one map into the input of the next. Stop for a second and consider what the output of the second one should be...
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>After a little thinking, it feels natural that the output of the second Hadamard gate will also be 50/50, after all, every Hadamard gate outputs 50/50, regardless of input. 
    We could also come to the same conclusion by following the possible paths, and adding up the probabilities of each path</p>

  <img src='Assets/two_hadamard_prob.png' width=800px class="center">
  

  <p>The picture above shows that if you start at the top input, you have a 50% chance to end up at the top output, which makes sense!<br>
  Now, we're ready to see how all of this will work when we use quantum circuits instead, things are about to get weird.</p>

<h2>Quantum Circuits</h2>
<p>
  A quantum circuit, is just like a probabilistic circuit, except that the edge weights may be complex numbers. Okay, now what does that mean?<br>
  Let's remake the Hadamard Gate, but in the quantum world.
